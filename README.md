# Time_constrained_Travelling_Christmas_market_visitor
Christmas is around the corner, and with that comes an optimisation problem! Imagine you are only one day in Vienna, but want to visit as many Christmas markets as possible (either for drinking Glühwein or shopping, whatever you prefer :-) ). Your task is thus to heuristically optimise a route that maximises the amount of markets you can visit1. Below you find a list of markets, but your dataset is still incomplete, as there are no timings between the markets, thus a first sub-task is to obtain those; ideally you use an API to query e.g. walking and public transport (Google maps: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/overview?hl=de, Wiener Linien or similar)
